# How to Deposit



## When can I deposit?

A user can deposit into the option vault(s) at any point in time except during the auction period when the option vault(s) are locked. Users who deposited their underlying asset mid epoch will not gain any potential upside and are exposed to any potential downside option risks. Therefore, it is highly encouraged for users to check the expiration date of the option vault(s) and initiate their deposit before the current epoch of the option vault(s) expires.

When a new epoch starts, the user's deposits would automatically enter the new epoch and start earning option premiums (yield) in the form of their underlying asset.

## How to Deposit?

First you need to select the vault you want to depsit into. Once a vault is selected you arrive at this screen displaying all informations about the specific vault:
