# How to Withdraw

### When can I withdraw?

There are two phases to completing a withdrawal: initiating withdraw and claiming withdrawals. Funds that were not locked can be withdrawn at any time using "Claim Withdrawal" action. For funds that are locked, an "Initiate Withdrawal" Action needs to be called. Then, funds join the withdrawal pool and once. they are become unlocked (eg after Friday morning each week), they can be claimed using "Claim Withdrawal" action.

### Initiate withdraw

A user can initiate withdrawals from any vault at any point in time except during the auction period when the option vault(s) are locked. After a user has initiated a withdrawal, it will show up as “withdrawal pending”. Users can cancel their withdrawal at any point in time before the epoch has ended.

Once the user initiates a withdrawal, their underlying assets will join a withdrawal pool. The underlying assets in the withdrawal pool will not participate in the next epoch cycle. Users will still receive the option premiums (yield) from the previous epochs that they have participated in.

### Claim withdrawals

Once the epoch has ended, users can claim their withdrawals from the withdrawal pool at any time by clicking on the claim button.\
