# Delta-Hedged Liquidity

In this strategy the investor stakes a cryptocurrency and then sells an equivalent amount of futures for the same currency. The short position in futures is managed as more yield is acquired to fully hedge the delta. Additionally, profit could be realised from the basis in the futures market. Effectively, the investor receives the staking yield in USD without crypto market risk.
