# Introduction

Yearn Finance has pioneered the use of vaults. Yearn vaults are like crypto savings accounts where funds are invested in the DEFI ecosystem in order to generate yield. Unlike in traditional finance, where funds can be opaque, those are deployed on public blockchains, where everything is visible and auditable in real time. Ribbon Finance created the first option vaults protocol.\


Yield Finance is a DEFI protocol extending the concept of decentralised vaults with a focus on complex option strategies, structured debt, structured products. The protocol is cross chain and extensible, integrating with the existing DEFI and CEFI ecosystems.
