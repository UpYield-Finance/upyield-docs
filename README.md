# What is UpYield Finance

UpYield Finance is a protocol that automates and packages complex digital asset trading strategies into decentralised vaults. Those strategies are mainly implemented as structured products focused on yield generation. The protocol is implemented with smart contracts and is structured as a DAO with a governance token. The token provides voting rights for protocol changes and DAO funding decisions. The protocol will earn fees distributed to token holders.
